## OpenCASCADE and FreeCAD

### OpenCasCade Overview

OpenCASCADE Technoloyg (OCCT) is kind of only full-feature, industrial-strength, open source CAD kernel, on which FreeCAD and Salome are built on. OCCT has been released under LGPL in 2013, not from OCC license any more, see <http://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-6.9.0/overview/html/technical_overview.html>.

The official (doxygen generated) document is here https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/index.html

> all OCCT classes organized in hierarchical form corresponding to OCCT  structure (module -> toolkit -> package -> class).



### Relation between OpenCascade(Salome) and FreeCAD

Table: Relation between OpenCascade(Salome) and FreeCAD

| FreeCAD | OpenCASCADE module                                           | Relation           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Base    | [Module FoundationClasses](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_foundationclasses.html) for math, smart pointer, | no                 |
| App     | [Module ApplicationFramework(OCAF)](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_applicationframework.html)<br />for Document and object organization | no                 |
| Gui     | [Module Visualization(VIS)](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_visualization.html), <br /> Salome platform has the GUI geometry builder module | no                 |
| Part    | [Module ModelingAlgorithms](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_modelingalgorithms.html),[Module ModelingData](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_modelingdata.html) | based on           |
| Import  | [Module DataExchange](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.3.0/refman/html/module_dataexchange.html) for brep, step and iges CAD format | based on           |
| Mesh    | surface mesh                                                 | partially based on |
| FEM     | `Salome mesh (SMESH)` format for volume mesh                 | partially based on |

When FreeCAD was designed in early 2000s, OCAF and VIS is not available, therefore, the FreeCAD team design their own infrastructure modules (Base, App and Gui).  

OCCT 's VIS component provides shapes via VTK library, in FreeCAD 3D shape renering is done by Coin3D/openInventor.


### TopoDS_Shape

Topology defines relationships between simple geometric entities. A shape, which is a basic topological entity, can be divided into components (sub-shapes):

- Vertex - a zero-dimensional shape corresponding to a point;
- Edge - a shape corresponding to a curve and bounded by a vertex at each extremity;
- Wire - a sequence of edges connected by their vertices;
- Face - a part of a plane (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D) bounded by wires;
- Shell - a collection of faces connected by edges of their wire boundaries;
- Solid - a finite closed part of 3D space bounded by shells;
- Compound solid - a collection of solids connected by faces of their shell boundaries.


### Salome platform

Salome 2019 has builder module, comparable with FreeCAD. 



**********************************************************************

## Part Module

`Part` module is coded in C++ for better performance (another reason: there is no python wrapping to the underlying CAD kernel: OpenCASCASE when FreeCAD was designed), but there is the official example of pure python implemented Feature like `Plot`. 



### Important headers in Part Module


### [src/Mod/Part/App/PartFeature.h]
```
class PartExport Feature : public App::GeoFeature
class FilletBase : public Part::Feature

        const TopoDS_Shape& shape, const TopoDS_Shape& face, const gp_Dir& dir)

                             const bool quick, const bool touch_is_intersection);

}
```

[src/Mod/Part/App/PartFeature.cpp]
```

[src/Mod/Part/App/PartFeature.cpp]

```
/** 2D Shape
  * This is a specialized version of the PartShape for use with
  * flat (2D) geometry. The Z direction has always to be 0.
  * The position and orientation of the Plane this 2D geometry is
  * referenced is defined by the Placement property. It also
  * has a link to a supporting Face which defines the position
  * in space where it is located. If the support is changed the
  * static method positionBySupport() is used to calculate a
  * new position for the Part2DObject.
  * This object can be used stand alone or for constraint
  * geometry as its descend Sketcher::SketchObject .

class PartExport Part2DObject : public Part::Feature

### Sketcher Module: 2D Geometry

[src/Mod/Sketcher/App/Sketch.h]  collection of Part::Geometry::Segment  and constraint, Base::Persistence

```

## Material Module

### Introduction of Material

Material properties are essential for physisic simulation, in the current trend of tight coupling of CAD and CAE. Commercial CAD all have their material database to power their CAE application, however, STEP CAD file change format (AP214) has has only density property for material which is not enough for simulation.

### Design of Material module

https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Material

### Material database in FreeCAD

Common solid material is listed in source code tree: [src/Mod/Material/StandardMaterial], Limited fluid material, water, air, are included in into [src/Mod/Material/FluidMaterial].  Once installed to the system, they are located at data folder.

Add new material is not complicated, by either from **Material Editor GUI**, importing ,etc.

#### modified material (saved into the FreeCAD document)

![FreeCAD_material_editor.png](../images/FreeCAD_material_editor.png)

Or by providing textual `*.FCMat` directly, here is an example of

```

#### import provided material database

User can create new material (by editing the existing materail in the Material Editor) or import from Fem/Cfd module.

![set path for extra material](images/FreeCAD_material_preference.png)

### Material  properties declaration

In the Material Editor, there are plenty properties, A yaml file [src/Mod/Material/Templatematerial.yml] , in order to add new property/quanity, its unit must be registered/found in FreeCAD unit dictory. 

<https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Units#Unit_dictionary>

> All the units available in FreeCAD, and new ones created by the user, should be stored in unit dictionary, which is an XML file (FreeCAD configuration file), so as to be retrieved when needed, i.e. when achieving unit scaling. 

```python
from FreeCAD import Units
dir(Units)
```

where is `the XML file (FreeCAD configuration file)` 

New property can be added in the Material Editor temperorily
