# Organisation of FreeCAD source code


## Build system for FreeCAD

**cmake** is the cross-platform build tool for FreeCAD. It  generates the make files, and also generates installer for windows, deb/rpm for Linux, and image bundle MacOS X.

see "cmake cheatsheet" in the appendix for quick start on cmake.

[src/CMakeLists.txt] is the main control build configuration file

```
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cMake")
```

[src/cMake] folder is filed with *.cmake file to detect libraries. If new workbench with c++ code will be added, such a third parties detection cmake file is proproably needed.

A global option ON switch should be added in [src/CMakeLists.txt]
Here is an example, since FreeCAD will not build OpenFOAM from source, justs install this binary, just like netgen, gmsh FEM meshing tools

```
if(NOT MSVC)
    OPTION(BUILD_FEM_FOAM "Build the FreeCAD FEM module with the OpenFOAM CFD solver" ON)
else
    OPTION(BUILD_FEM_FOAM "Build the FreeCAD FEM module with the OpenFOAM CFD solver" OFF)
endif(NOT MSVC)
```
later in the the toplevel cmake file [src/CMakeLists.txt]

```
# -------------------- OpenFOAM --------------------
    if (BUILD_FEM_FOAM)
        find_package(FOAM)
    endif(BUILD_FEM_FOAM)

```

### Analysis of `src/cMake/SMesh.cMake`

```shell
# Try to find Salome SMESH
# Once done this will define
#
# SMESH_FOUND         - system has Salome SMESH
# SMESH_INCLUDE_DIR   - where the Salome SMESH include directory can be found
# SMESH_LIBRARIES     - Link this to use Salome SMESH
#


IF (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)
    FIND_PATH(SMESH_INCLUDE_DIR SMESH_Mesh.hxx
    # These are default search paths, why specify them?
    # /usr/include
    # /usr/local/include
    PATH_SUFFIXES smesh
    )
    FIND_LIBRARY(SMESH_LIBRARY SMESH
    #  /usr/lib
    #  /usr/local/lib
    )
ELSE (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)
    # Not yet implemented
ENDIF (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)

SET(SMESH_FOUND FALSE)
IF(SMESH_LIBRARY)
  SET(SMESH_FOUND TRUE)
  GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR ${SMESH_LIBRARY} PATH)
  set(SMESH_LIBRARIES
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriver.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverDAT.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverSTL.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverUNV.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMDS.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMESH.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMESHDS.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libStdMeshers.so
  )
ENDIF(SMESH_LIBRARY)
```

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration, building and testing automation, in a simple word, is crucial to maintain a software project efficiently.

### Travis CI


Travis is tightly integrated with github, and it is widely used in github repo. The guide for setup Travis for github repo can be found here <https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis>.

The main config file for FreeCAD is [.travis.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.travis.yml)  for Linux and OSX platforms or [.travis/build.bat](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.travis/build.bat) for windows platform only

### Other CI tools

Travis is not the only CI product. There is a comparison of CI Software:
see< https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software>

[.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)
which pull docker image to setup testing environment.

### arcconfig and phabricator

```javascript
"phabricator.uri" : "http://pha.geofinder.eu/"
```
### vagrant cloud VM

FreeCAD has a subfolder to setup cloud VM for building and testing

### docker configuration
[subuser/freecad-dev](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/subuser/freecad-dev)
[.subuser.json] 	adds subuser files for developing freecad within a Docker container.

### AppVoyer

Sign up and setup github and bitbucket repo is simple, see official document <https://www.appveyor.com/docs/>. FreeCAD project use AppVoyer for building on windows, althought it is a cross-platform solution.


## Packaging and Deployment

### linux rpm and deb, AppImage

### windows and OSX prebuild


## List of files and folders in FreeCAD source folder



## List of modules in FreeCAD Mod folder



## Learning path

1. be familar with FreeCAD Gui Operation as a user

see [FreeCAD wiki user hub](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/), tutorials on youtube and [user manual]()

2. be familar with Python scripting, learning from macro recording.

The amazing feature of FreeCAD is that all GUI operation is recorded in Python console
[FreeCAD wiki power user hub](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Power_users_hub)
[FreeCAD wiki developer hub](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Developer_hub)

3. be familar with key classes in FreeCAD source code: Base, App, Gui, Part

It is really challenging to code in C++, Python GIL, Coin3D, OCC. However, it is  not needed to know about OCC as module developers.
FreeCAD has a online API document for import classes like Properties, Document Objects, see <http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Power_users_hub#API_Functions>

4. develop/extend pure Python module, the challenging Python wrapping task can be avoided

5. develop/extend hybrid C++ and Python module

6. write 3D rendering code, i.e. ViewProvider derived classes
