# Organisation of FreeCAD source code

The FreeCAD official repository has the standard github project layout, with Readme, license, continuous integration setup files at the repository root. The FreeCAD [source tree in the src folder](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/src/Ext/freecad)  reflects its modular design.

## Build system for FreeCAD

### introduction to CMake

cmake** is the cross-platform build tool for FreeCAD. It  generates the make files, and also generates installer for windows, deb/rpm for Linux, and image bundle MacOS X.

see "cmake cheatsheet" in the appendix for quick start on cmake.



### CMake in FreeCAD

The project top level `CMakeLists.txt` at the repositiory root is very long, detecting third party library detection and dealing compiler and OS differences.  In constrast, [src/CMakeLists.txt] in the source tree is the much shorter, with `add_directory(subfolder_name)`. 

[cMake](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/cMake)  folder in the repo root is filed with *.cmake file to detect libraries. If new workbench with c++ code will be added, such a third parties detection cmake file is proproably needed.]

```
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cMake")
```


Here is an example code (not existent), since FreeCAD will not build OpenFOAM from source, justs install this binary,like netgen, gmsh FEM meshing tools

```
if(NOT MSVC)
    OPTION(BUILD_FEM_FOAM "Build the FreeCAD FEM module with the OpenFOAM CFD solver" ON)
else
    OPTION(BUILD_FEM_FOAM "Build the FreeCAD FEM module with the OpenFOAM CFD solver" OFF)
endif(NOT MSVC)
```
later in the the toplevel cmake file [src/CMakeLists.txt]

```
# -------------------- OpenFOAM --------------------
    if (BUILD_FEM_FOAM)
        find_package(FOAM)
    endif(BUILD_FEM_FOAM)

```

### Code Analysis for `[cMake/SMesh.cMake](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/cMake/SMesh.cMake)`

```shell
# Try to find Salome SMESH
# Once done this will define
#
# SMESH_FOUND         - system has Salome SMESH
# SMESH_INCLUDE_DIR   - where the Salome SMESH include directory can be found
# SMESH_LIBRARIES     - Link this to use Salome SMESH
#


IF (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)
    FIND_PATH(SMESH_INCLUDE_DIR SMESH_Mesh.hxx
    # These are default search paths, why specify them?
    # /usr/include
    # /usr/local/include
    PATH_SUFFIXES smesh
    )
    FIND_LIBRARY(SMESH_LIBRARY SMESH
    #  /usr/lib
    #  /usr/local/lib
    )
ELSE (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)
    # Not yet implemented
ENDIF (CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCC)

SET(SMESH_FOUND FALSE)
IF(SMESH_LIBRARY)
  SET(SMESH_FOUND TRUE)
  GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR ${SMESH_LIBRARY} PATH)
  set(SMESH_LIBRARIES
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriver.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverDAT.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverSTL.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libDriverUNV.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMDS.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMESH.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libSMESHDS.so
    ${SMESH_LIBRARY_DIR}/libStdMeshers.so
  )
ENDIF(SMESH_LIBRARY)
```

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration, building and testing automation, in a simple word, is crucial to maintain a software project efficiently.

### Travis CI


Travis is tightly integrated with github, and it is widely used in github repo. The guide for setup Travis for github repo can be found here <https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis>.

The main config file for FreeCAD is [.travis.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.travis.yml)  for Linux and OSX platforms or [.travis/build.bat](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.travis/build.bat) for windows platform only

### Other CI tools

Travis is not the only CI product. There is a comparison of CI Software:
see< https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software>

[.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/.circleci/config.yml)
which pull docker image to setup testing environment.

### arcconfig and phabricator

```javascript
"phabricator.uri" : "http://pha.geofinder.eu/"
```
### vagrant cloud VM

FreeCAD has a subfolder to setup cloud VM for building and testing

### docker configuration
[subuser/freecad-dev](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/subuser/freecad-dev)
[.subuser.json] 	adds subuser files for developing freecad within a Docker container.

### AppVoyer

Sign up and setup github and bitbucket repo is simple, see official document <https://www.appveyor.com/docs/>. FreeCAD project use AppVoyer for building on windows, although it is a cross-platform solution.


## Packaging and Deployment

### Linux RPM and Deb, AppImage

FreeCAD has been in official repo of major linux distro, but the version may be outdated. For Ubuntu, there is PPA to install the latest or even daily development build.  It is recommended for developers to install lattest version, especially Qt5+Python3 combination. 

### Windows and OSX prebuild

Windows installer is generated by NSIS, and open source windows installer generation tool. Packaging for windows its in another subproject `FreeCADInstProj`, see https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/src/WindowsInstaller

### Other cross platform package managers

The package folder in the repository root contains the `[conda]()` recipe to build Anaconda package. Conda is a popular binary python package (python module compiled from other languages) distribution system. 

`fedora` subfolder has the configuration 

## Learning path

1. be familiar with FreeCAD Gui Operation as a user

see [FreeCAD wiki user hub](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/), tutorials on youtube and [user manual]()

2. be familiar with Python scripting, learning from macro recording.

The amazing feature of FreeCAD is that all GUI operation is recorded in Python console
[FreeCAD wiki power user hub](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Power_users_hub)
[FreeCAD wiki developer hub](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Developer_hub)

3. be familiar with key classes in FreeCAD source code: Base, App, Gui, Part

It is really challenging to code in C++, Python GIL, Coin3D, OCC. However, it is  not needed to know about OCC as module developers.
FreeCAD has a online API document for import classes like Properties, Document Objects, see <https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Power_users_hub#API_Functions>

4. develop/extend pure Python module, the challenging Python wrapping task can be avoided

5. develop/extend hybrid C++ and Python module

6. write 3D rendering code, i.e. ViewProvider derived classes
