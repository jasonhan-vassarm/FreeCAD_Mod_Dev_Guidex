## Why I want to write this book

- Learn the software architecture of FreeCAD: a large open source project
- Learn to use git to contribute to open source projects like FreeCAD
- Save time for new developers to explore the source codde of FreeCAD
- Record personal note and lesson during writing/contributing code to FreeCAD
- Some chapters of this ebook is seeking to be merged into official wiki after reviewed as usable

My research: "Automated and Intelligent Engineering Design"

## How to contribute to this ebook

- write on unfinished topics/chapters listed in todo.md
  fork and pull request `git clone https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide.git`
- file bug for outdated code analysis
  As this book is about code analysis while FreeCAD is under heavy development, source codes quoted may outdated quickly.
